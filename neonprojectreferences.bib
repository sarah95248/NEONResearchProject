            The Integrated Microbial Genomes \& Microbiomes system (IMG/M: https://img.jgi.doe.gov/m/) at the Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Genome Institute (JGI) continues to provide support for users to perform comparative analysis of isolate and single cell genomes, metagenomes, and metatranscriptomes. In addition to datasets produced by the JGI, IMG v.7 also includes datasets imported from public sources such as NCBI Genbank, SRA, and the DOE National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC), or submitted by external users. In the past couple years, we have continued our effort to help the user community by improving the annotation pipeline, upgrading the contents with new reference database versions, and adding new analysis functionalities such as advanced scaffold search, Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) for high-quality metagenome bins, new cassette search, improved gene neighborhood display, and improvements to metatranscriptome data display and analysis. We also extended the collaboration and integration efforts with other DOE-funded projects such as NMDC and DOE Biology Knowledgebase (KBase).},

	abstract = {Gammaproteobacteria is a class of bacteria in the phylum Pseudomonadota (synonym Proteobacteria).  It contains about 250 genera, which makes it the most genus-rich taxon of the Prokaryotes. Several medically, ecologically, and scientifically important groups of bacteria belong to this class. All members of this class are Gram-negative. It is the most phylogenetically and physiologically diverse class of the Pseudomonadota.Members of Gammaproteobacteria live in several terrestrial and marine environments, in which they play various important roles, including in extreme environments such as hydrothermal vents. They can have different shapes, rods, curved rods, cocci, spirilla, and filaments, and include free living bacteria, biofilm formers, commensals and symbionts; some also have the distinctive trait of being bioluminescent. Diverse metabolisms are found in Gammaproteobacteria; there are both aerobic and anaerobic (obligate or facultative) species, chemolithoautotrophics, chemoorganotrophics, photoautotrophs and heterotrophs.},
